> Graduate researcher at the University of Maryland, College Park, working in the lab of [Najib El-Sayed](http://www.najibelsayed.org/research.aspx). Research interests include co-expression and network analysis of dual-species transcriptomics datasets, network parameter optimization, and gene regulatory element prediction. Passionate about open and reproducible research methods and efficient software engineering approaches for the sciences.

> Computer Science PhD student at the university of Maryland, College Park, working in [Hannenhalli lab](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~sridhar/) and [HCBravo lab](http://www.hcbravo.org). Researcn interests range from Deep learning to Genomics. More psecifically, she is passionate about exploting the advantage of language translation and deep learning into multi-omics data to understand the regulatory mechanism across cells and diseases. Outside school, she enjoys learning foreign languages, painting, reading about human psychology and cross-cultural differences.

> PhD Student from the Bay Area, working in the labs of Phil Bourne (NCBI/UVA) and Mike Grigg (NIAID) through the BU-NIH GPP. Eli is interested in the structural and evolutionary view of pathogen invasion in Apicomplexan parasites (e.g. Malaria and Toxoplasmosis). When he is not doing science, you can find him rock climbing or playing drums with his band Dothraki Deception.
